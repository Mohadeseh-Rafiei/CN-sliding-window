The U.S. Army Research Laboratory has developed a dataset of faces to train facial recognition that works in darkness.

Facial recognition has already come a long way since U.S. Special
Operations Forces used the technology to help identify Osama bin Laden
after killing the Al-Qaeda leader in his Pakistani hideout in 2011.

The Army Research Laboratory Visible and Thermal Face
dataset contains 500,000 images from 395 people. it is one of the
largest and most comprehensive datasets that includes matching
images of people’s faces taken under both ordinary visible-light
conditions and with heat-sensing thermal cameras in low-light
conditions.

Early benchmark testing with the dataset showed that
facial recognition algorithms struggled to either identify key facial features
or identify unique individual faces from thermal camera
images—especially when the normal details visible in faces are reduced to
blobby heat patterns.

The algorithms also struggled with “off-pose” images in which the
person’s face is angled 20 degrees or more away from center

And they had problems matching the visible-light images of individual faces withtheir thermal imagery counterparts when the person was wearing glasses in
one of the images.

The dataset development was sponsored by the Defense Forensics
& Biometrics Agency, which manages a U.S. military database filled with
images of faces, fingerprints, DNA, and other biometric information from
millions of individuals in countries such as Afghanistan and Iraq,
according to documents obtained by OneZero. The agency has also issued
contracts to several U.S. companies to develop facial recognition
technology that works in the dark—efforts that might benefit from the new
training dataset.

The Army Research Laboratory team and its university
research partners collected the images for their dataset from adult
volunteers under a careful informed consent process with oversight from
an Institutional Review Board that holds the responsibility for monitoring
biomedical research. That contrasts with the more controversial practices
of research groups or companies such as Clearview AI that have scraped
social media websites and the public internet to collect images of faces.
